# Personal Knowledge Management

---

For the past twenty years, I've been using Microsoft OneNote as the mainstay of my knowledge management system or "second brain". I especially valued being able to access it from any of my devices (Windows PC and laptop, iPad, mobile phone), to save a web page into it directly from my browser, and to dictate a quick note into it when on the go. Another benefit was that I could use my iPad to write freehand or draw sketches directly into a note. Where it fell short was in the connecting of ideas to help me think through problems. Early in 2025, I read about the open-source combination of <a href="https://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. They seemed a better match to my needs and more forward-looking, so [[Digital Garden/Setting up Obsidian\|I tried them out]].
