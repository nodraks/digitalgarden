# Personal Knowledge Management

---

For the past twenty years, I've been using Microsoft OneNote as the mainstay of my knowledge management system or "second brain". I especially valued being able to:

- access it from PC, laptop, iPad, and mobile phone;
- save a web page into it directly from my browser; 
- dictate a quick note while on the go; and
- use my iPad to write freehand notes or draw sketches directly into OneNote. 

Where it fell short was in the connecting of ideas to help me think through problems. Early in 2025, I read about the open-source combination of <a href="https://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. They seemed more forward-looking and a better match for my needs, so [[Digital Garden/Setting up Obsidian\|I tried them out]]. First impressions are good; I like them, and Obsidian in particular offers interesting possibilities. 

One of these possibilities is an Obsidian plug-in called <a href="https://smartconnections.app">Smart Connections</a>. This embeds my notes in a [[07 - Atoms/vector database\|vector database]], similar to an AI's knowledge store. When working on a note in Obsidian, I am now shown links to other notes with related content; I can look for connections and think creatively about them. This happens entirely on my local computer with no online involvement, thus preserving privacy. 

Another possibility is to connect Obsidian to an AI. This will open up many interesting ways to explore and develop my ideas. It also opens me to the temptation of outsourcing my thinking to the machine, and it poses a risk to my privacy. The latter could be avoided by installing the AI locally. There are several ways of doing that; the one offering most bang for your buck is a [[Digital Garden/VPN client-server 1\|VPN client/server]]. But the temptation to outsource my thinking is a more pernicious danger. It brings us round full circle to the need for an ethos of caring about how the Human-AI relationship evolves.
