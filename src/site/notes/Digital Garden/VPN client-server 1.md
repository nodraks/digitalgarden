When you use a large language model (LLM) like an AI assistant, it can run either on your own computer at home or on powerful computers in the cloud (over the internet). Running an LLM on your own local computer, like a desktop or mini PC, gives you important benefitsâ€”especially privacy since your data stays with you and isnâ€™t sent to outside servers.

If you install an LLM directly on a laptop, you might face some limits because laptops usually have less powerful processors and less memory than desktops or mini PCs. This means the LLM might run slower or not handle very complex tasks as smoothly.

A desktop or mini computer at home tends to have better performance with faster processing and more memory. This makes them better for running bigger or more advanced LLMs, offering a smoother experience and faster results than a typical laptop.

To use your home computerâ€™s LLM remotelyâ€”say from your phone or another device when youâ€™re awayâ€”you can set up something called a VPN (Virtual Private Network). Think of a VPN like a secure tunnel that connects your remote device to your home computer over the internet, making it feel like youâ€™re right there on your home network. Setting this up involves:

- Installing VPN software on your home computer (the server).
    
- Configuring your home internet router to allow secure access.
    
- Installing VPN software on the device you want to connect from (the client).
    
- Connecting through the VPN to safely use your home computer and its LLM wherever you are.
    

This way, you keep your data private and secure while still enjoying the power of your homeâ€™s AI capabilities from anywhere.
