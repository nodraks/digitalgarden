# A workspace for my brain: the concept

> [!info] Concept
> > The *workspace for my brain* is an idea factory. But rather than an assembly line, think of it as a network of interconnected ideas at varying levels of maturity and complexity.  It let's me bring in other people's thinking, helping me capture ideas and add them to my existing network of knowledge. The ideas must be discoverable, yet retain enough context for each to be understandable.  I must be able to draw on and remix them in order to create new ideas and original thoughts; and it must be easy for me to share that thinking. Above all, the *workspace for my brain* must suit the way I think; it should be structured and organised - tailored - for me individually. 

> [!info] Principle
> Where appropriate, the workspace will have structured content organised by cognitive function: reference, concept, principle, process, or task. 


> [!info] Principle
> Daily Notes act as a journal to capture fleeting thoughts, plan AI interactions, record reflections. 
>
>A Read Later folder holds material that might be interesting to me, for later inspection. 
>
> A Sources folder holds source material in the form of newsletters, Web, articles, YouTube videos, and AI chats. 

> [!info] Process
> Each sources goes through a process of progressive summarisation, represented by layers. 
> 
> - Layer 0 is the original, full-length source text.
>- Layer 1 is the content that I initially bring into Obsidian.
>- Layer 2 is the first round of true summarization, in which I highlight only the best parts of the passages I’ve imported. 
> - Layer 3, I bold text within the highlighting, so I can make out the smaller number of higher value passages among all the highlighted ones.
> - Layer 4, I’m still summarizing, but going beyond highlighting the words of others, to writing and recording my own.
> - Finally, for a minority of sources, the ones that I want to become part of how I think and work, I remix them. After pulling them apart and dissecting them in layers 1–4, I add my own thinking and turn them into separate pieces of writing.
> - Some of these are added to the notes for an area of interest to me or for an active project.
> - Others are published in the Digital Garden.

> [!info] Principle
> A Resources folder holds material that is not of immediate value but might be useful later. 
>
>An Areas folder holds my notes grouped by areas currently of interest to me. 
>
>A Projects folder holds my notes grouped by active projects. 
>
> A Digital Garden folder holds the notes that have been written for publication on the web.
