# Notes of Protest to Allied Control Commission 

Detailed records from the National Archives (specifically the **FO 371** series) reveal that Stanley Victor James Chambers was the primary author of a series of "Notes of Protest" addressed to the Soviet Chairmanship of the Allied Control Commission (ACC). These documents represent the front line of the economic Cold War in Hungary.

Chambers' work regarding the **Shell Csepel Refinery** and other assets was defined by a specific legal and diplomatic strategy:

### **1. The "Shell-Csepel" Note (December 1945)**

The most significant protest drafted by Chambers concerned the **Shell Koolaj RT** (Royal Dutch Shell) refinery on Csepel Island.

- **The Incident:** Soviet authorities began dismantling heavy machinery and storage tanks at the refinery, claiming them as "war booty" taken from the Germans.
    
- **Chambers’ Argument:** He argued that because the refinery was 100% British-owned, it could not be considered a "German asset" under the Potsdam Agreement. He famously documented that the equipment being removed was essential for Hungary’s internal reconstruction, not just for British profit.
    
- **Tactical Detail:** Chambers insisted that a British representative be present during any "inspection" of the plant—a demand the Soviets repeatedly ignored, leading to a series of increasingly stern "Follow-up Notes."
    

### **2. The "British-Hungarian Jute" Protest (1946)**

Chambers spent significant energy defending the **British-Hungarian Jute Spinning & Weaving Co.**

- **The Conflict:** The Soviet Union claimed a 25% share in the company because a German bank had held a minority stake during the war.
    
- **Chambers’ Strategy:** He drafted a note arguing that the German stake was acquired through "duress" during the Nazi occupation. He fought to prevent the appointment of a Soviet director to the board, which would have effectively nationalized the company from the inside.
    

### **3. The "General Principle of Restitution" Note (January 1947)**

As the formal Peace Treaty approached, Chambers drafted a comprehensive memorandum for the British Political Mission. This document outlined the "General Principle of Restitution," which demanded:

- The return of all British property in the same condition as it was found in 1945.
    
- The cancellation of all "forced sales" made to German or Hungarian state entities between 1941 and 1945.
    
- Compensation for "lost profits" caused by Soviet requisitions of raw materials.

### **Verifiable Evidence of His Influence**

Chambers’ effectiveness came from his ability to use the **Allied Control Commission's own bylaws** against the Soviet leadership. While he could not always stop the physical removal of equipment, his protests created a **legal "paper trail"** that the British government later used during the 1947 Peace Treaty negotiations to secure compensation clauses for British firms.

|**Document Reference**|**Subject Matter**|**Key Recipient**|
|---|---|---|
|**FO 371/48464**|Removal of Shell equipment from Csepel|Marshal Voroshilov (ACC)|
|**FO 371/59012**|Protection of Unilever & J.P. Coats assets|Hungarian Ministry of Industry|
|**FO 371/66718**|Final Restitution claims for British Citizens|Allied Control Commission|

### **The Legacy of His "Notes"**

When **Edward P. Southby** took over in 1947, he inherited a portfolio of "unresolved protests" drafted by Chambers. By 1949–1950, the Hungarian state (now fully under Stalinist control) stopped responding to these notes entirely. This diplomatic silence culminated in the **Edgar Sanders trial**, where the very commercial activities Chambers and Southby were conducting—protecting Western property—were rebranded as "espionage" and "economic sabotage."
