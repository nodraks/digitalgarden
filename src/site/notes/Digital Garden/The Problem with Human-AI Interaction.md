# The Problem with Human-AI Interaction
*PHAIN for short* 

*This is the story of how we used the writing of an essay to learn how AI can be used to support that kind of work. As you read on, please keep in mind that it is a work in progress.*

## The problem

Dennis Silverwood put forward some [[07 - Atoms/Warning Thoughts\|Warning Thoughts]]. These begin by asserting that, although widely called artificial intelligence, AI is not in fact intelligent. They end by highlighting the risk that people might outsource their thinking to AI and lose or never acquire the ability for critical thinking. While all age groups are at risk from outsourced thinking, the young are especially so. They already show signs of shorter attention spans, limiting their capacity to follow complex arguments, absorb nuanced information, and sustain reasoning without distraction. If this is compounded by outsourcing their thinking and failing to develop critical thinking skills, they risk losing the judgement and decision-making ability essential to independent agency.

## How to explore the problem?

A good way to get a better understanding of the the problem would be to carry out a study: do some research and write an essay about it. This would examine the dangers posed to young people by the temptation to outsource their thinking to AI, and it would explore whether responsible use of AI can mitigate these dangers. As well as making us better informed, the essay would serve as a vehicle for learning the practicalities of putting AI to purposeful use.

## Some background about using AI

Some background is needed here.  If we want AI to stay helpful and relevant, we need to give it the right information to hold in its working memory - in what is called its **context**.  [[Digital Garden/What is context\|What is context]] explains what this means. For the AI to perform well on our behalf, its context must encompass and keep pace with the progress of the work for which it is assisting us. [[Digital Garden/Goal-Directed Context Management v1\|Goal-Directed Context Management v1]] describes how we can handle this during the development of a knowledge-based product such as an essay. 

## Purpose

We do not at present have the resources to carry out the study suggested above. We can, however, go some way down that path by using AI to begin setting up such as study. The purpose of doing so is to test the value of the [[Digital Garden/Goal-Directed Context Management v1\|Goal-Directed Context Management v1]] approach. 
## The Project Startup experiment

### A bootstrap prompt

The starting point was to configure ChatGPT so that it could begin to help us with this work. [[Digital Garden/Goal-Directed Context Management v1#AI artefacts\|Goal-Directed Context Management v1#AI artefacts]] suggests we should have an *AI startup pack* to configure the AI for its initial role at the outset of a project. To obtain that, I began with a [[07 - Atoms/PHAIN bootstrap prompt\|bootstrap prompt]]. This gave the AI an explanation of the work we were about to do together, and tasked it to help me create an improved version of the prompt. 

> Your first task is to advise how this prompt can be improved to make most effective use of your capabilities. But before beginning, review the information you now have in your context and ask me for any clarification you need. Do nothing else yet.

Once I had provided the [[Digital Garden/PHAIN bootstrap clarification\|clarification]] it sought, the AI responded with this [[Digital Garden/PHAIN startup prompt\|startup prompt]]. It was a useful step forward, but I realised that what I really needed was a set of *project instructions*; I would be setting up a ChatGPT project for the essay work, and would need to manage the AI's behaviour in that space.  

### AI startup pack

After some discussion with the AI, we arrived at this [[Digital Garden/PHAIN structure for project instructions\|structure for project instructions]] matched to the task in hand.  Before turning these into a draft set of instruction, I thought I'd better remind the AI about the distinction between project instructions and project files. I asked: 

>Help me understand the division or boundary between the content of Project Instructions and the content of reference material in Project Files.

It responded with this explanation of the [[Digital Garden/The distinction between Project Instructions and Project Files\|distinction between Project Instructions and Project Files]]. With this in its memory, I told the AI to draft a set of project instructions, using the structure we had agreed earlier, while remembering to keep what would become project files clearly ring-fenced as reference material. After some editing, the outcome was these [[Digital Garden/Project Instructions for AI & Young People Essay\|Project Instructions for AI & Young People Essay]]. Together with some reference files, these constituted the *AI Startup Pack*. 

### Outputs required from startup 

With the *AI Startup Pack* now installed in the AI's context (in its project instructions and project files), the question was: what outputs are required from the startup process of the wider project to write the essay? They might include:

- a clear description of the project deliverable (the essay itself);
- a rationale / justification for undertaking the project;
- the intended management structure for the project;
- the project approach.

Typically, all the above would be packaged in a *Project Brief*. An *Initiation Stage Plan* would also be required, setting out the work needed to produce outputs from the Initiation Stage such as the *Project Plan*. 

In a conventional project, we would then move into the Initiation Stage. In an AI-assisted project, however, we must first produce the *Initiation Stage AI Pack*. This sets out the AI's configuration for that stage; i.e. it defines the context needed by the AI in order to support the Initiation Stage most effectively. 

To summarise: after producing all the Startup products needed by a conventional project to begin its Initiation Stage, an AI-assisted project must also produce its *Initiation Stage AI Pack*. 

### The *Project Brief*  

Task for the AI:  given what's in your context, draft a clear description of the project deliverable.
Response: initially very quick but muddled, with some nonsense. I told it to think harder, and after 52 seconds it produced a much better effort.
Outcome: a comprehensive first draft of [[Digital Garden/Product Description - Essay\|Product Description - Essay]] 
Status: needs review

Task for the AI: draft a rationale / justification for the project
Response: a good draft
Outcome: well-written first drafts of the [[Digital Garden/Rationale for the project\|Rationale for the project]] 
Status: needs review

To summarise: the AI can provide valuable, time-saving assistance for production of the *Project Brief*. 

## Findings

Similarly to when using a conventional computer, the first step was to *bootstrap* the AI. This involved prompting it with as good as possible a description of intentions for the project, and then working with it to develop an *AI Startup Pack*. 

The *AI Startup Pack* consisted of *project instructions* and *reference files*. These were put into the AI's context within a ChatGPT project space. Working in that project space, after an initial hiccup the AI produced good quality first draft material for use in the *Project Brief*, one of the main outputs from project startup. 

## Discussion & Recommendations

We explored use of an AI to support the startup of a project. The purpose of the project was to research and write an essay. 

During *Startup*, there was quite a lot of time spent prepping the AI as compared to doing productive work with it. The balance of prep time versus productive working time is likely to shift heavily towards the latter during *Initiation* and later stages.

Reason for the AI's initial hiccup: Unless otherwise directed, ChatGPT-5 chooses a reasoning level based on its interpretation of the complexity of the prompt. It underestimated, in this case. Prompts need to be explicit about the reasoning level required of it. 

Standard procedure should be to produce all conventional outputs required from a given stage in the project, and only then produce the *AI Pack* needed to support the the next stage of work. 

[[Digital Garden/Goal-Directed Context Management v1\|Goal-Directed Context Management v1]] was found to be a good approach to the use of AI within a knowledge-based project. It is recommended for further exploration and development.

## Reflections

In my experience, the learning and retention of knowledge comes through writing down and working through ideas. For example, the process of thinking about what words to write in the Introduction to [[Digital Garden/Goal-Directed Context Management v1\|Goal-Directed Context Management v1]] crystallised half-formed ideas into a fuller understanding that is now held in my memory. The AI served a useful purpose in asking me to clarify things, forcing me to write them down and think them through. But did I begin to lose agency as it then repackaged my ideas in useful ways?
