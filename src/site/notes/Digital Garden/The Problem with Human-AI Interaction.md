## The problem

Dennis Silverwood put forward some [[07 - Atoms/Warning Thoughts\|Warning Thoughts]]. These begin by asserting that, although widely called artificial intelligence, AI is not in fact intelligent. They end by highlighting the risk that people might outsource their thinking to AI and lose or never acquire the ability for critical thinking. While all age groups are at risk from outsourced thinking, the young are especially so. They already show signs of shorter attention spans, limiting their capacity to follow complex arguments, absorb nuanced information, and sustain reasoning without distraction. If this is compounded by outsourcing their thinking and failing to develop critical thinking skills, they risk losing the judgement and decision-making ability essential to independent agency.

## How to explore the problem?

An essay, based on research, could examine the dangers posed by the temptation to outsource our thinking to AI. It could also explore whether responsible use of AI can mitigate these dangers. As well as making us better informed, the essay could serve as a vehicle for learning the practicalities of putting AI to purposeful use.

Some background is needed here.  If we want AI to stay helpful and relevant, we need to give it the right information to hold in its working memory - in what is called its **context**.  [[Digital Garden/What is context\|What is context]] explains this. For the AI to perform well on our behalf, its context must encompass and keep pace with the progress of the work for which it is assisting us. [[Digital Garden/Goal-Directed Context Management v1\|Goal-Directed Context Management v1]] describes how we can handle this during the development of a knowledge-based product such as an essay. 

We do not at present have the resources to carry out the study suggested above. We were able, however, to test the value of the [[Digital Garden/Goal-Directed Context Management v1\|Goal-Directed Context Management]] approach by going some way down that path in a [[Digital Garden/Project Startup experiment\|project startup experiment]].


## Findings

Similarly to when using a conventional computer, the first step was to *bootstrap* the AI. This involved prompting it with as good as possible a description of intentions for the project, and then working with it to develop an *AI Startup Pack*. 

The *AI Startup Pack* consisted of *project instructions* and *reference files*. These were put into the AI's context within a ChatGPT project space. Working in that project space, after an initial hiccup the AI produced good quality first draft material for use in the *Project Brief*, one of the main outputs from project startup. 

## Discussion & Recommendations

We explored use of an AI to support the startup of a project. The purpose of the project was to research and write an essay. 

During *Startup*, there was quite a lot of time spent prepping the AI as compared to doing productive work with it. The balance of prep time versus productive working time is likely to shift heavily towards the latter during *Initiation* and later stages.

Reason for the AI's initial hiccup: Unless otherwise directed, ChatGPT-5 chooses a reasoning level based on its interpretation of the complexity of the prompt. It underestimated, in this case. Prompts need to be explicit about the reasoning level required of it. 

Standard procedure should be to produce all conventional outputs required from a given stage in the project, and only then produce the *AI Pack* needed to support the the next stage of work. 

[[Digital Garden/Goal-Directed Context Management v1\|Goal-Directed Context Management v1]] was found to be a good approach to the use of AI within a knowledge-based project. It is recommended for further exploration and development.

## Reflections

In my experience, the learning and retention of knowledge comes through writing down and working through ideas. For example, the process of thinking about what words to write in the Introduction to [[Digital Garden/Goal-Directed Context Management v1\|Goal-Directed Context Management v1]] crystallised half-formed ideas into a fuller understanding that is now held in my memory. The AI served a useful purpose in asking me to clarify things, forcing me to write them down and think them through. But did I begin to lose agency as it then repackaged my ideas in useful ways?
