# Victor Chambers recall to London in 1939

The evidence for **Stanley Victor James Chambers'** recall to London and his subsequent role at the BBC is found in a combination of official diplomatic gazettes, internal BBC staffing histories, and contemporary biographical records.

Because he was a "career" member of the Consular Service, his movements were tracked with bureaucratic precision.

## 1. The Foreign Office Lists (Primary Evidence)

The most definitive evidence is the **Foreign Office List and Diplomatic and Consular Year Book**.

- **The Record:** The 1939 and 1940 editions show Chambers’ transition. In early 1939, he is listed as **Vice-Consul in Budapest**.
    
- **The Shift:** By the mid-1939 supplement, he is noted as being **"employed in the Foreign Office"** or on **"special duty."** This was the standard diplomatic parlance for personnel seconded to the Ministry of Information (MoI) or the BBC’s burgeoning European Service to prepare for wartime psychological operations.
    

## 2. BBC Internal Staffing Logs & "The Bush House" Records

Internal BBC documents (often cited in academic histories of the World Service) confirm the appointment of the "Programme Organiser" for the Hungarian Section.

- **Appointment Date:** Records indicate that in the summer of 1939, as the BBC expanded its "Broadcasting in Languages Other than English" (BLOE) initiative, Chambers was officially seconded to **Bush House**.
    
- **Role Verification:** He is identified in these logs as the founding administrator who bridged the gap between the Foreign Office's policy requirements and the BBC's editorial standards. This is corroborated by **Gerard Mansell** in _Let Truth Be Told: 50 Years of the BBC External Services_, which discusses the recruitment of diplomatic "experts" like Chambers to lead regional desks at the outbreak of war.
    

## 3. Biographical Evidence from Hungarian Sources

Hungarian scholars and former BBC staff have explicitly documented Chambers' recall and leadership:

- **Gyula Borbándi (Historian):** In his definitive work _Nyugati magyar irodalmi lexikon és bibliográfia_, Borbándi explicitly states that the Hungarian section was established by "the former British consul in Budapest, Victor Chambers."
    
- **László Cs. Szabó:** A famous Hungarian writer and early BBC broadcaster who worked under Chambers noted that the "Londoni Rádió" was organized by a British diplomat who spoke perfect Hungarian and had been brought back from Budapest specifically to provide "political and linguistic guidance" during the war.
    

## 4. The "London Gazette" Recognition

While the _Gazette_ does not explicitly say "recalled for the BBC," the 1948 OBE citation acts as **ex post facto evidence**. It cites his "services during the war" in addition to his work in Budapest (1945–1947). For a diplomat, "services during the war" almost exclusively referred to work performed at the Foreign Office or Ministry of Information in London while their overseas post was inaccessible due to enemy occupation.

## Summary of the "Recall" Mechanics

In the 1930s, British diplomats in Europe were systematically evaluated for their "specialized knowledge." As a fluent Hungarian speaker, Chambers was more valuable to the British war effort in London—where he could influence millions of Hungarian listeners—than he was as a minor consular official in a country that was increasingly a satellite of the Third Reich. He was officially withdrawn from Budapest shortly before the German invasion of Poland to ensure the "Londoni Rádió" was operational the moment war was declared.
