## What is a digital garden?

[Maggie Appleton's](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) essay *A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden* describes it as "*A newly revived philosophy for publishing personal knowledge on the web ... A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren’t strictly organised by their publication date. They’re inherently exploratory – the ideas are linked through contextual associations. They aren’t refined or complete, but are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They’re less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we’re used to seeing.*"

## Origin and tools

One of the originators of the term was Mike Caulfield, who is one of my [thought leaders](https://anapoly.co.uk/labs/thought-leaders/). He delivered a keynote address [The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY&feature=emb_logo) at the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network. It later became [an essay](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) that lays the foundations for our current understanding of digital gardening.

Maggie Appleton's own essay [Digital Gardening for Non-Technical Folks](https://maggieappleton.com/nontechnical-gardening) explains how to build a digital garden without touching code. One of the gardening tools she highlights is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a private knowledge base that allows you to publish a selection of notes as a public website. As I am already using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for my *ideaverse*, that is how this garden is being produced.

## Some good advice (which I am not yet following!)

**Assumed Audience** [Maggie Appleton's advice](https://maggieappleton.com/assumed-audience) is to include a small informational box at the beginning of a post, to identify the intended audience. That allows one to write for an informed audience without defining every term and qualifying every statement.

**Epistemic Disclosure** [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/epistemic-disclosure) recommends providing clear metadata on the epistemic validity of content.
