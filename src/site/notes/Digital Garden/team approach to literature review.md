# Team approach to literature review

The most practical approach for **structuring the work** is to split it by thematic area. Assuming a team of five, divide sources according to the _four refined key questions_ (temptations, dangers, responsible use, mitigation).

- Person A: Temptations    
- Person B: Dangers – cognitive/learning impacts    
- Person C: Dangers – social/ethical impacts    
- Person D: Nature of responsible AI use   
- Person E: Mitigation strategies

This allows each reviewer to go deep into one theme.  To avoid ending up with five differently structured sets of notes from our reviewers, we use:

- a shared source capture template; 
- clear tagging rules so everyone uses the same temptation/danger/mitigation codes;
- a source quality checklist so everyone applies the same credibility criteria.

For each source, the capture template might record:

- citation + link
- source type (academic, news, think tank, etc.)
- summary (≤200 words)
- relevant temptation(s)
- relevant danger(s)
- mitigation strategies mentioned
- evidence strength (Strong / Mixed / Weak)
- direct quotes worth preserving

Coordination and integration will be important. A shared repository will be needed. Periodic reviews will let people see each other’s work and adjust theirs as necessary. Cross-checking pairs could be set up, each person reviewing one other person’s entries for clarity, completeness, and tagging accuracy. Finally, all findings will be compiled into a temptation–danger–mitigation matrix for analysis.
