Here is a prioritized list of additional security measures when using VPN client/server access to a local LLM over the internet:

1. **Strong Authentication (Multi-Factor Authentication â€“ MFA):** The most critical step to prevent unauthorized VPN access, protecting against password theft and brute-force attacks.
    
2. **Use Secure VPN Protocols:** Implement modern, robust protocols like WireGuard or OpenVPN to ensure encrypted and secure data transmission.
    
3. **Regularly Update Software:** Keep VPN software, client devices, and server systems patched and up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.
    
4. **Access Controls and Least Privilege:** Restrict VPN access only to essential users and limit their permissions to reduce risk exposure.
    
5. **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the LLM server within a separate network segment to minimize damage if access is compromised.
    
6. **Firewalls Configuration:** Configure firewalls to only allow VPN traffic on necessary ports and block unauthorized connections.
    
7. **Monitor and Log Activity:** Continuously monitor VPN and LLM access logs for suspicious behavior and potential breaches.
    
8. **Encrypt Data at Rest:** Protect stored data on the LLM server with encryption to safeguard information if physical access is breached.
    
9. **Limit VPN Session Time:** Implement session timeouts and revoke access when no longer needed to reduce attack windows.
    

This order reflects the balance between preventing unauthorized access, securing data transmission, and limiting potential damage from breaches, aligning with best VPN security practices.
