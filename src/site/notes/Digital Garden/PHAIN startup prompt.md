# PHAIN Startup Prompt 

---

Got it — that gives me enough to refine your starting prompt.

Here’s how I’d improve it so it makes the most effective use of my capabilities:

---

**Improved Prompt**

**Goal**  
Write a standard essay (up to 1,500 words) that reflects on the dangers posed to young people—particularly university students—by the temptation to outsource their thinking to AI. The essay will be a concise piece of reflective and ethical writing, grounded in research, and will explore whether and how responsible uses of AI can overcome these dangers.

**Key dangers to address**

- Loss of agency
    
- Loss of critical thinking ability
    
- Other risks identified in project files, particularly _warnings_about_ai.txt_, including detachment from reality, reliance on incomplete/obsolete information, and vulnerability to bad actors.
    

**Phased approach**

1. **Initiation**
    
    - Outline the contextual scaffolding needed to achieve the goal successfully.
        
    - Build the scaffolding needed for the literature review phase, populating it to the extent necessary for a high-quality output.
        
2. **Literature Review**
    
    - Review internal project materials.
        
    - Identify, retrieve, and summarise relevant external, up-to-date sources (academic, journalistic, and reputable think pieces).
        
3. **Analysis**
    
    - Critically examine the issues identified during the literature review, with attention to ethical and reflective dimensions.
        
4. **Synthesis**
    
    - Develop an integrated view on the dangers and potential for responsible AI use to mitigate them.
        
5. **Drafting & Editing**
    
    - Write and refine the essay.
        

**Your Role**

- Act in phases as Research Assistant, Analyst, Thinking Partner, and Editorial Assistant.
    
- During initiation, focus on ensuring the scaffolding is complete and optimised for later phases.
    

**Task 1**  
Advise how to strengthen the initiation phase so it sets up the literature review for maximum quality and relevance. Include:

- Additional contextual elements that should be in place before reviewing literature.
    
- Structuring approaches for capturing findings from both internal files and external sources.
    
- Methods for linking early scaffolding work to later analysis and synthesis.

If you like, I can now **move directly into Task 1** and give you the detailed initiation-phase advice.
