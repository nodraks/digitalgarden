# A digital garden for ideas about shaping Human-AI interaction
*digital garden: a place to share and develop ideas in a flexible, interconnected, and constantly updated space.*  
*ideas develop from seed → growing → well-formed → fruitful → retired*

Maggie Appleton describes [[Digital Garden/digital gardening\|digital gardening]] as the nurturing of ideas, connecting them through contextual association rather than publication date. Beginning as seeds, the ideas grow and evolve through thinking. Some prove fruitful, others less so. 

The first seed in this garden was planted during a philosophical exchange with Giles Freathy, when we talked about the danger of outsourcing our thinking to AI and he commented that we need to have an ethos of caring about how the Human-AI relationship evolves. That led to the thought of how [[Digital Garden/Values, Ethics, Culture, & Ethos\|values, ethics, culture, and ethos]] fit together.

- **Values**, our moral compass;
- **Ethics**, how we apply them;
- **Culture**, where values and ethics live;
- **Ethos**, the vibe or spirit of that culture.

But what is AI, and how do we interact with it? By AI, we usually mean large language models. They are not in fact intelligent yet, but they can seem so. It's estimated that approaching a billion people now use AI in one way or another. Most commonly, this is through a chat interface such as that offered by ChatGPT, which reportedly has nearly 500 million users. We interact with the "chatbot" through its [[Digital Garden/What is context\|context]].
