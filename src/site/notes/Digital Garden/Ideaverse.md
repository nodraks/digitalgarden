# IDEAVERSE: a workspace for the brain

My initial attempts to use Obsidian proved over-complicated. Searching for a better way, I found <a href="https://stephango.com/vault">Steph Ango’s explanation</a> of how he uses his creation (Steph is the CEO of Obsidian). It is beautifully simple, and I have adopted the same approach. 

Everything is in one vault. My own thinking (something I wrote, or that relates directly to me - my personal world) is in the root of that vault. 

There are two reference folders:
- *References* where I write about things that exist outside my personal world: people, places, events, books, and so on.  
- *Clippings* where I file other people's writing; I use the <a href="https://stephango.com/obsidian-web-clipper">Obsidian web clipper</a> to save web articles and pages (along with their metadata) directly into notes in that folder. 

I use three admin folders so that their content can be excluded from the file navigation: 
- *Attachments* for images, audio, videos, PDFs, etc.
- *Daily Notes*, all named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. I do not write anything in daily notes, they exist solely to list all the notes I have worked on that day.
- *Templates* that can be applied to the various types of note.

Key to the value of the *ideaverse* are extensive <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/link-notes">internal links</a>, the use of <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/properties">properties</a> and <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/templates">templates</a>, and the integration of <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/bases">bases</a> (database-like views of my notes) into templates and reference notes. These techniques create a network of ideas that can be navigated and searched easily. It is a powerful aid to thinking. 

Another valuable feature is the ability to <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/publish">publish selected notes</a> (such as this one) on the web with minimum effort.
