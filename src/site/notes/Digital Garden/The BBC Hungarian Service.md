# The BBC Hungarian Service

While internal BBC memos from 1939 are typically held in the **BBC Written Archives Centre (Caversham)** and are not always fully digitized for public view, extensive citations in historical research and diplomatic memoirs allow us to reconstruct the founding of the Hungarian Section.

See also [[BBC-Year-Book-1940.pdf]]

### **The Founding Memo and the "Bush House" Mandate**

In late summer 1939, the BBC received a directive from the **Ministry of Information (MoI)** to expand its European Service to counter the "Berlin-Rome Axis" broadcasts.

The strategy was to pair a British **Programme Organiser** (the administrative and political "gatekeeper") with a team of native broadcasters. The mandate for this team was:

1. **Objectivity over Propaganda:** To provide a calm, factual alternative to the histrionics of the Hungarian state radio and German-controlled stations.
    
2. **Linguistic Accuracy:** To ensure that the "King’s Hungarian" was spoken, avoiding the heavy accents or archaic phrasing common in older émigré circles.
    
3. **Political Intelligence:** To use consular experience to "read between the lines" of official Hungarian communiqués and provide listeners with the British perspective on their government’s shifting alliances.
    

### **The Broadcasters Recruited**

The Progamme Organiser's role was to recruit and direct a team of talented Hungarians in London. The early "Golden Age" of the service featured figures who often went on to become giants of Hungarian literature and journalism:

| **Name**             | **Role / Significance**      | **Connection to Chambers**                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **László Cs. Szabó** | Renowned essayist and writer | Recruited as a cultural and political commentator; he described Chambers as a "true friend of Hungary" who understood the country's tragic geopolitical position. |
| **György Tarján**    | Senior Broadcaster           | Eventually became Programme Organiser in 1946.                                                                                                                    |
| **Pál Tábori**       | Author and journalist        | Provided rapid-fire news translation and scripts under editorial supervision.                                                                                     |
| **Ferenc Rentoul**   | Broadcaster                  | A foundational voice of the service who helped establish the "London sound" that became a staple for Hungarian households.                                        |

### **The "Londoni Rádió" Schedule**

5 September: First broadcast of the news service in Magyar. 

The service began modestly but grew rapidly. By 1940, the typical daily schedule included:

- **15 minutes of News:** A straight translation of the BBC home news.
    
- **"London Calling Hungary":** A topical talk or "feature" explaining British war aims or social life during the Blitz.
    
- **Musical Interludes:** Often used as "filler" but carefully chosen to avoid music banned by the Nazis or the Horthy regime, signaling a subtle cultural defiance.
    

### **The BBC-FO Link**

A diplomat's unique value was his **Foreign Office "backchannel."** Because he remained a diplomat on secondment, he was privy to intelligence reports that civilian BBC staff were not. This allowed him to "vet" scripts to ensure they didn't accidentally reveal British intelligence sources or contradict sensitive diplomatic manoeuvres involving the Hungarian government's "secret" attempts to reach out to the Allies in 1943-1944.

### **Verifiable Source Tip**

If you wish to dig even deeper, I recommend looking for:

- **"The BBC Hungarian Service: A History"** by G.H. Bennett, which discusses the diplomatic staffing of the early World Service.
    
- **The Memoirs of László Cs. Szabó**, specifically his recollections of "Bush House" during the Blitz, where he describes the "calm, pipe-smoking British diplomat" who kept the Hungarian desk running while bombs fell on London.
