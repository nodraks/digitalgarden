At the foundation are **values**, the beliefs and principles about what is important, desirable, or right. They answer the question: What matters most to us? Values may be personal (honesty, curiosity), organisational (innovation, accountability), or societal (justice, equality). They are the moral “raw material” from which everything else flows.

**Ethics** is where values become explicit, systematic guidance for behaviour. An ethical framework takes values (and sometimes external influences like laws and professional standards) and turns them into principles, rules, or reasoning methods. Ethics asks: given our values, how should we act, and why? Formal ethics codifies expectations; informal ethics may be embedded in culture without being written down.

**Culture** is the lived environment shaped by shared history, relationships, language, and traditions. It is how people actually live and work together over time. Culture naturally expresses shared values but also shapes them, reinforcing some, downplaying others. It develops whether or not there is any formal ethical guidance. When culture comes first, it carries implicit norms: unwritten but widely understood expectations of behaviour. These can act like an informal ethical framework, but they are not always coherent, inclusive, or consciously examined.

**Ethos** refers to the characteristic spirit or “feel” of a group; the lived expression of values within a culture. While ethics defines the rules and reasoning, ethos captures the atmosphere and collective character that emerges when values are embodied in daily life. Ethos is tangible in tone, traditions, and shared habits: e.g., a research lab where “integrity and curiosity” aren’t just rules, but felt in how people question, listen, and share.

Putting it together:

*Values* are the starting point, our moral compass.
*Ethics* provide a reasoned map to guide how we apply those values in real situations.
*Culture* is the social terrain where these values and ethics live, evolve, and sometimes clash.
*Ethos* is the vibe or spirit of that culture when values are actively lived out.
