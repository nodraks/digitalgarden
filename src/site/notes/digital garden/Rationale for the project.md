# Rationale for the project
*Status: needs review*

---

## Short Rationale (≤100 words, for general readers)

Young people, especially university students, are increasingly tempted to let AI think for them. While convenient, this can erode critical thinking, weaken independent judgement, and expose them to misinformation or manipulation. This project explores both the dangers of such dependency and the possibility that responsible AI use might instead strengthen learning. The essay aims to provoke thought, spark debate, and equip readers with practical principles for using AI wisely—so that technology becomes a partner in education, not a substitute for human agency.

## Extended Rationale (~150 words, for educators and policymakers)

University students stand at a critical junction: immersed in a culture where AI offers instant answers, they face strong temptations to outsource thinking. The risks are significant—loss of agency, decline in critical reasoning, detachment from reality, and exposure to incomplete or manipulated information. If unaddressed, these dangers threaten not only academic integrity but also the development of the skills society most needs in future leaders. This project responds by producing a concise, ethically reflective essay that examines these risks while asking whether responsible AI use can mitigate them. Its aim is twofold: to inform and caution young people about the hazards of dependency, and to provide educators and policymakers with a framework for fostering constructive AI engagement. By clarifying dangers and highlighting responsible practices, the essay supports a culture where AI strengthens rather than undermines human learning and judgement.
