**Values** are the starting point — our moral compass.
**Ethics** is a reasoned map that guides how we apply those values in real situations.
**Culture** is the social terrain where these values and ethics live, evolve, and sometimes clash.
**Ethos** is the _vibe_ or spirit of that culture when values are actively lived out.
