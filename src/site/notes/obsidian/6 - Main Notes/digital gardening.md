# Digital Gardening
A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren’t strictly organised by their publication date. They’re inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren’t refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They’re less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we’re used to seeing.

**Assumed Audience** [Maggie Appleton's advice](https://maggieappleton.com/assumed-audience) is to include a small informational box at the beginning of a post, to identify the intended audience. That allows one to write for an informed audience without defining every term and qualifying every statement.

**Epistemic Disclosure** Providing clear metadata on the epistemic validity of content (https://maggieappleton.com/epistemic-disclosure)

**Blogchain** A self-contained series of blog posts on the same topic.
