# Structure for Project Instructions

*Advice offered by AI*

---

For maximising my effectiveness on this project, I’d recommend a slightly richer structure than the one I just proposed — it would give me **clear operational guidance** and **decision-making criteria** at every phase.

Here’s what I suggest:

---

### **Project Instructions – Recommended Structure (Project-Specific)**

1. **Purpose & Intended Impact**
    
    - The overarching goal and why it matters.
        
    - The intended effect on the target audience.
        
2. **Scope & Focus**
    
    - Who and what the project is about.
        
    - What is in-scope and what is explicitly out-of-scope.
        
3. **Key Questions**
    
    - Core questions the work must answer.
        
    - Sub-questions for different phases.
        
4. **Phases & Deliverables**
    
    - Detailed description of each phase (initiation, literature review, etc.).
        
    - Expected outputs and decision points per phase.
        
5. **Roles & Responsibilities**
    
    - How I should operate in each phase (Research Assistant, Analyst, Thinking Partner, Editorial Assistant).
        
    - Expected style, depth, and reasoning for outputs in each role.
        
6. **Reference Material & Sources**
    
    - Internal project files and how they should be used.
        
    - External sources: criteria for selection, diversity of perspectives, freshness.
        
7. **Constraints & Quality Standards**
    
    - Language, tone, and formatting preferences.
        
    - Rules for evidence use and attribution.
        
    - Requirements for clarity, precision, and balance.
        
8. **Iteration & Review**
    
    - How outputs are reviewed, refined, and approved.
        
    - Criteria for moving from one phase to the next.

This structure is **optimised for my capabilities** because:

- It eliminates ambiguity at each step.
    
- It bakes in checkpoints so we don’t drift off-track.
    
- It specifies quality criteria up-front, which means I can self-check before presenting work.
    

If you like, I can now draft the **tailored Project Instructions** for this essay using this structure. That would lock in the operational plan before we move into Task 1.
