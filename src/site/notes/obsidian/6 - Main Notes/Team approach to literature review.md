# Team approach to literature review

The most practical approach is to **split by thematic area**. Assuming a team of five, divide sources according to the _four refined key questions_ (temptations, dangers, responsible use, mitigation).

- Person A: Temptations    
- Person B: Dangers – cognitive/learning impacts    
- Person C: Dangers – social/ethical impacts    
- Person D: Nature of responsible AI use   
- Person E: Mitigation strategies

This ensures each reviewer goes deep into one theme but still uses the same capture format.
