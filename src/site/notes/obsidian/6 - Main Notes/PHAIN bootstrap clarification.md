# PHAIN bootstrap clarification

## Clarification sought by the AI

Before starting **task 1**, I’d like to clarify a few points so I can give you the most effective advice on improving your prompt:

1. **Scope of "young people"** – Are you focusing on university students only (as suggested in _warnings_about_ai.txt_), or more broadly on school pupils, early career professionals, etc.?
    
2. **Length and format of short-form essay** – Are we aiming for something like 500–800 words, op-ed style, or a shorter, sharper think piece?
    
3. **Use of literature** – When you say “review the literature,” should that be limited to the project files and your prior knowledge, or should I also pull in external, up-to-date sources?
    
4. **Tone and audience** – Should the essay lean towards academic argument, persuasive public writing, or more of a reflective/ethical think piece?
    
5. **Weighting of dangers vs. positive framing** – Should the essay focus almost entirely on the risks, or also acknowledge responsible/beneficial uses of AI for young thinkers?
    

Once I have these answers, I can refine your prompt so it fully leverages my capabilities and sets up the initiation phase for success.

## Clarification provided to the AI

1. The scope initially is broad. Later, during analysis and synthesis, we will focus on university students. 
2. Change the goal to be a standard essay. This will be a concise piece of reflective writing, length up to 1,500 words.
3. Pull in external, up-to-date sources. 
4. The essay should lean towards a reflective/ethical think piece.
5. The focus will be on if and how responsible uses of AI can overcome the dangers posed to young people.
