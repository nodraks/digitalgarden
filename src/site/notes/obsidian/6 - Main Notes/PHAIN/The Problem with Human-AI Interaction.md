# The Problem with Human-AI Interaction
*PHAIN for short* 

*This is the story of how we used the writing of an essay to learn how AI can be used to support that kind of work. As you read on, please keep in mind that it is a work in progress and not complete.*

## The problem

Dennis Silverwood put forward some [[obsidian/6 - Main Notes/PHAIN/Warning Thoughts\|Warning Thoughts]]. These begin by asserting that, although widely called artificial intelligence, AI is not in fact intelligent. They end by highlighting the risk that people might outsource their thinking to AI and lose or never acquire the ability for critical thinking. While all age groups are at risk from outsourced thinking, the young are especially so. They already show signs of shorter attention spans, limiting their capacity to follow complex arguments, absorb nuanced information, and sustain reasoning without distraction. If this is compounded by outsourcing their thinking and failing to develop critical thinking skills, they risk losing the judgement and decision-making ability essential to independent agency.

## Proposal to research & report

To get a better understanding of the nature of the problem, we proposed writing an essay about it. This would examine the dangers posed to young people by the temptation to outsource their thinking to AI, and it would explore whether responsible use of AI can mitigate these dangers. As well as making us better informed, the essay would serve as a vehicle for learning the practicalities of putting AI to purposeful use.

## Some background about using AI

Some background is needed here.  If we want AI to stay helpful and relevant, we need to give it the right information to hold in its working memory - in what is called its **context**.  [[obsidian/Digital Garden/What is context\|What is context]] explains what this means, and another perspective is offered in [[obsidian/Digital Garden/ChatGPT-5 context architecture\|ChatGPT-5 context architecture]]. For the AI to perform well on our behalf, its context must encompass and keep pace with the progress of the work for which it is assisting us.  [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Goal-Directed Context Management\|Goal-Directed Context Management]] suggests how we can handle this during the development of a knowledge-based product. 
## Startup

### A bootstrap prompt

Turning back to our proposed essay, the starting point was to configure ChatGPT so that it could begin to help us with this work. [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Goal-Directed Context Management#AI artefacts\|Goal-Directed Context Management#AI artefacts]] suggests we should have an *AI startup pack* to configure the AI for its initial role at the outset of a project. To obtain that, I began with a [[obsidian/6 - Main Notes/PHAIN/PHAIN bootstrap prompt\|bootstrap prompt]]. This gave the AI an explanation of the work we were about to do together, and tasked it to help me create an improved version of the prompt. 

> Your first task is to advise how this prompt can be improved to make most effective use of your capabilities. But before beginning, review the information you now have in your context and to ask me for any clarification you need. Do nothing else yet.

Once I had provided the [[obsidian/6 - Main Notes/PHAIN bootstrap clarification\|clarification]] it sought, the AI responded with this [[obsidian/6 - Main Notes/PHAIN startup prompt\|startup prompt]]. It was a useful step forward, but I then realised that what I really needed was a set of *project instructions*;  I would be setting up a ChatGPT project for the essay work, and would need to manage the AI's behaviour in that space.  

### AI startup pack

After some discussion with the AI, we arrived at this [[obsidian/6 - Main Notes/PHAIN structure for project instructions\|structure for project instructions]] matched to the task in hand.  Before turning these into a draft set of instruction, I thought I'd better remind the AI about the distinction between project instructions and project files. I asked: 

>Help me understand the division or boundary between the content of Project Instructions and the content of reference material in Project Files.

Tt responded with this explanation of the [[obsidian/Digital Garden/The distinction between Project Instructions and Project Files\|distinction between Project Instructions and Project Files]],  and I told the AI to draft a set of project instructions, using the structure we had agreed earlier, while remembering to keep what would become project files clearly ring-fenced as reference material. After some editing, the outcome was these [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Project Instructions for AI & Young People Essay\|Project Instructions for AI & Young People Essay]]. Together with some reference files, these constituted the *AI Startup Pack* I needed. 

### Outputs from startup 

With the startup pack now installed, I paused for thought. The question was: what outputs are required from the startup process? They might include:

- a clear description of the project deliverable;
- a rationale / justification for undertaking the project;
- the management structure for the project;
- the project approach

Typically, all the above would be packaged in a *Project Brief*. An *Initiation Stage Plan* would also be needed. We would then be in a position to prepare the *Initiation Stage AI Pack*. This would set out how to configure the AI for that stage; i.e. to define the context AI would need in order to support the initiation stage most effectively. 

### The project brief 

Task for the AI:  a clear description of the project deliverable
Response: initially very quick but muddled, with some nonsense. I told it to think harder, and after 52 seconds it produced a much better effort.
