# Background

Acclimatisation Lab run by Anapoly, attended by Giles Freathy.
Discussion Giles Freathy / Alec Fearon about possibilities for collaboration between out two organisations.
Collaboration would be designed to extend the capability of both organisations for the social good. 
Students are among those most at risk from the misuse of AI. 
There is a risk that students might outsource their thinking to AI and lose or not acquire the ability for critical thinking. 
There is a need to imbue students with values of benefit to society. 
Students need to have an ethos of caring about how the human-AI relationship evolves.
Hence idea of an initiative to create an ethos designed to shape Human-AI interaction in the university setting.
