## Purpose

To propose how values and ethos can shape human–AI interaction in a university setting.

## Approach  
We would frame this as a time-bounded project making use of the Anapoly AI Labs. 
The main deliverable would be a substantive, long-form essay offering a credible academic contribution.
The project would also form a live, documented case study in the effective, ethical, and collaborative use of AI tools.

## Twofold value 

**Academic output** – A credible, well-researched essay proposing a framework of values and ethos for guiding human–AI interaction.

**Applied learning** – A live, documented example of using AI in a real intellectual task, showing good practice in configuration, transparency, and collaboration.
