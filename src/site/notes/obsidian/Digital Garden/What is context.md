# What is context?

---

 Context is the new user interface.
 
 When you use an AI like ChatGPT, there are no menus or toolbars. Instead, the way you interact – what you say, how you say it, and what you show it – _is_ the interface.

That’s what we mean by **context**. It’s the information you give the AI to help it understand what you want. A vague prompt gives you a vague answer. A clear prompt, with the right background, gets you something much more useful.

This new kind of interface has several parts:

- **Prompt window** – where you ask questions and give tasks
- **Custom instructions** – where you shape the AI’s behaviour
- **File uploads** – where you provide background material to an individual chat
- **Project files** – where you store persistent context that can be referred to by all chats in the project space
- **Canvas** – a workspace you share with the AI where you can both edit text.

You don’t click buttons. You build context. And the better the context, the better the response from the AI.
