# What is an AI's context?

---

 Context is the AI's user interface. When we work with a general-purpose AI like ChatGPT, we interact with it through it's context.  We do this in several ways. 
 
 The most immediately obvious is the **chat window**. Here, you can conduct a conversation with the AI, instructing, guiding and questioning it in real time. 

- To work jointly with the AI on shared text, we use a **canvas**. It is opened by the AI, alongside the chat window, when we tell it to. It works like a text editor in which both human and AI can edit the content. 

- We can share files with the AI during a chat by uploading them into the chat window. This lets us refer the AI, during a conversation, to information contained in the files. 

The AI stores our chats until we choose to delete them, and we can resume a chat from where we left off. But the AI cannot yet refer to the content of an earlier chat during the course of the current chat. 

A less obvious way to interact with the AI is through **custom instructions**. These are like settings, letting us configure how the AI behaves across all our chats with it. We can give it information such as:
- what to call us;
- what we do;
- what kind of personality the AI should have;
- what traits it should have; and
- any other behavioural instructions we want to give it. 

To collaborate with the AI on a larger piece of work, where we want several 

That’s what we mean by **context**. It’s the information you give the AI to help it understand what you want. A vague prompt gives you a vague answer. A clear prompt, with the right background, gets you something much more useful.

This new kind of interface has several parts:

- **Custom instructions** – where you shape the AI’s behaviour
- **Prompt window** – where you ask questions and give tasks
- **File uploads** – where you provide background material to an individual chat
- **Project files** – where you store persistent information that can be referred to by all chats in the project space
- **Canvas** – a workspace you share with the AI where you can both edit text.

You don’t click buttons. You build context. And the better the context, the better the response from the AI.
