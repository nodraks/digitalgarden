# What is an AI's context?

---

 Context is the AI's user interface.
 
 When you work with a general-purpose AI like ChatGPT, there are no menus or toolbars. Instead, what you tell it, where you put what you are telling it, and the additional reference material you show it – all these things are the interface.

That’s what we mean by **context**. It’s the information you give the AI to help it understand what you want. A vague prompt gives you a vague answer. A clear prompt, with the right background, gets you something much more useful.

This new kind of interface has several parts:

- **Custom instructions** – where you shape the AI’s behaviour
- **Prompt window** – where you ask questions and give tasks
- **File uploads** – where you provide background material to an individual chat
- **Project files** – where you store persistent information that can be referred to by all chats in the project space
- **Canvas** – a workspace you share with the AI where you can both edit text.

You don’t click buttons. You build context. And the better the context, the better the response from the AI.
