# The Initiation Phase

Earlier, we opened a ChatGPT project space for our essay project and configured it with a good set of project instructions to guide the behaviour of the AI (see [[obsidian/6 - Main Notes/PHAIN/The Problem with Human-AI Interaction#Startup\|The Problem with Human-AI Interaction#Startup]]). We now wanted to focus on preparing the ground for the literature review.
