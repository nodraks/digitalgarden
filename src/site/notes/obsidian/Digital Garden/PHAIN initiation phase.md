# The Initiation Phase

Earlier, we opened a ChatGPT project space for our essay project and configured it with a good set of project instructions to guide the behaviour of the AI (see [[obsidian/6 - Main Notes/PHAIN/The Problem with Human-AI Interaction#Startup\|The Problem with Human-AI Interaction#Startup]]). We now wanted to focus on preparing the ground for the literature review. 

First, we refined the [[obsidian/Digital Garden/refined key questions for the literature review\|key questions for the literature review]] and considered the possibility of giving the literature review to a team of, say, five people, dividing up the key questions accordingly. See [[obsidian/Digital Garden/team approach to literature review\|team approach to literature review]]. 

Second, we prepared a [[obsidian/Digital Garden/definition of terms\|definition of terms]].

Have been tidying up, editing, and taking stock of where we've got to. I think I now need to pause for thought. 

[[obsidian/Digital Garden/Goal-Directed Context Management#AI artefacts\|Goal-Directed Context Management#AI artefacts]] identifies various AI artefacts. I have already produce the bootstrap prompt and arguably a sufficient *AI Startup Pack*. Other artefacts identified so far are:

- AI policy;
- AI management plan;
- stage packs.

The *AI Policy* is self-evident in what is currently a one-person+AI project. 
The *AI Management Plan* sounds as though it should be important, so I'd better give it some thought. But I guess it's an output from the Initiation Stage, and I'll want the AI's help to write it, so the *Initiation Stage AI Pack* must be a good place to go next. To clarify: the purpose of the *Initiation Stage AI Pack* is to configure the AI's context so that it can most effectively help us during the Initiation Stage. 

The AI needs to know what outputs we want from the Initiation Stage, together with descriptions of their purpose, content, and quality criteria.
