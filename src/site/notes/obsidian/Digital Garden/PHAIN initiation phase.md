# The Initiation Phase

Earlier, we opened a ChatGPT project space for our essay project and configured it with a good set of project instructions to guide the behaviour of the AI (see [[obsidian/6 - Main Notes/PHAIN/The Problem with Human-AI Interaction#Startup\|The Problem with Human-AI Interaction#Startup]]). We now wanted to focus on preparing the ground for the literature review. 

First, we refined the [[obsidian/Digital Garden/refined key questions for the literature review\|key questions for the literature review]] and considered the possibility of giving the literature review to a team of, say, five people, dividing up the key questions accordingly. See [[obsidian/Digital Garden/team approach to literature review\|team approach to literature review]]. 

Second, we prepared a [[obsidian/Digital Garden/definition of terms\|definition of terms]].

Have been tidying up, editing, and taking stock of where we've got to. I think I now need to pause for thought. We are still in project startup, so the question is: what outputs are required from the startup process? They might include:

- a clear description of the project deliverable;
- a justification for undertaking the project;
- the management structure for the project;
- the project approach

Typically, all the above would be packaged in the *Project Brief*.
An *Initiation Stage Plan* will also be needed.
We will then be in a position to prepare the *Initiation Stage AI Pack*. This will set out how to configure the AI; i.e. what context it needs in order to support the initiation stage most effectively. We will produce this pack in collaboration with the AI, putting the *Project Brief* and the *Initiation Stage Plan* (and no doubt other material yet to be defined) into its context for that purpose.
