# The Initiation Stage

Earlier, we opened a ChatGPT project space for our essay project and configured it with a good set of project instructions to guide the behaviour of the AI (see [[obsidian/6 - Main Notes/PHAIN/The Problem with Human-AI Interaction#Startup\|The Problem with Human-AI Interaction#Startup]]). We now wanted to focus on preparing the ground for the literature review. 

First, we refined the [[obsidian/Digital Garden/refined key questions for the literature review\|key questions for the literature review]] and considered the possibility of giving the literature review to a team of, say, five people, dividing up the key questions accordingly. See [[obsidian/Digital Garden/team approach to literature review\|team approach to literature review]]. 

Second, we prepared a [[obsidian/Digital Garden/definition of terms\|definition of terms]], currently without the actual definitions.
