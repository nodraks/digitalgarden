# Distinction between Project Instructions and Project Files

I asked ChatGPT to help me understand the division or boundary between the content of Project Instructions and the content of reference material in Project Files. This is how the AI explained it. 

Here’s a clear way to see the difference — it’s about **function vs. substance**.

## **1. Project Instructions** → _The “How”_

- **Function:**    
    - They are the _operational playbook_ for how we run the project.        
    - They tell me _what to do, how to do it, in what order, and to what standards_.
        
- **Content type:**    
    - Purpose, scope, roles, workflow, quality standards, review process.        
    - Decision rules — how to select sources, how to judge relevance, how to move between phases.
        
- **Example (from your current work):**
    
    > _In the literature review phase, select at least five external sources published in the last three years from academic journals, reputable news outlets, or recognised think tanks. Summarise each source in under 200 words, highlighting relevance to key dangers and potential mitigations._

## **2. Reference Material in Project Files** → _The “What”_

- **Function:**    
    - They are the _knowledge base_ we draw from to build content.        
    - They give me the _substantive material_ — facts, quotes, data, ideas — to work with.
        
- **Content type:**    
    - Reports, notes, essays, quotes, background context, case studies, existing analyses.        
    - In this project: ethos documents, AI warnings, contextual scaffolding papers.
        
- **Example (from your files):**    
    >_“There is a risk that students might outsource their thinking to AI and lose or not acquire the ability for critical thinking”_warnings_about_ai._

### **Key distinction**
- **Project Instructions** → procedural framework; defines the _rules of engagement_.    
- **Reference Material** → substantive input; provides the _raw material_ to be analysed and synthesised.
    
You can think of **Instructions** as the _recipe_, and **Reference Material** as the _ingredients_.
