# Programme Approach Example — Development of a Policy Framework

This example shows how the programme approach can be applied to the creation of a new organisational policy framework. The objective is initially broad and uncertain, requiring a phased programme to progressively reduce uncertainty, align stakeholders, and deliver a comprehensive and effective policy set. Each phase is treated as a discrete project with its own deliverables, schedule, and governance.

## Concept

- Identify the need for a new policy framework (e.g., changes in legislation, organisational restructuring, or new strategic priorities).
    
- Outline high-level objectives, potential scope, and intended outcomes.
    
- Identify key stakeholders and decision-makers.
    
- Produce an initial options paper for consideration.
    

## Feasibility

- Evaluate potential approaches to developing the framework, considering scope, complexity, resource requirements, and organisational impact.
    
- Conduct stakeholder consultations to assess support and identify constraints.
    
- Estimate costs, timelines, and risks for each option.
    
- Recommend a preferred approach and seek approval to proceed.
    

## Definition

- Translate the approved approach into detailed specifications for the policy framework.
    
- Define scope, structure, thematic areas, and interrelationships between policies.
    
- Establish acceptance criteria and compliance requirements.
    
- Assign roles, responsibilities, and timelines for the development phase.
    

## Development

- Draft individual policies and related guidance documents.
    
- Integrate existing materials where possible and ensure consistency across the framework.
    
- Conduct iterative reviews with subject matter experts and stakeholders.
    
- Manage version control and incorporate feedback.
    

## Acceptance

- Submit the full policy framework for formal review by governance bodies.
    
- Validate alignment with organisational strategy and regulatory obligations.
    
- Address any issues identified during review.
    
- Secure final approval.
    

## Operation & Maintenance

- Implement the framework across the organisation, supported by training and communications.
    
- Monitor use and effectiveness, gathering feedback from end users.
    
- Update policies in response to changes in legislation, strategy, or operational needs.
    

## Retirement

- When the framework becomes obsolete or is replaced, formally withdraw it.
    
- Communicate changes to all stakeholders and ensure replacement frameworks are in place.
    
- Archive the superseded framework for reference or compliance purposes.
