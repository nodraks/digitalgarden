# Goal-Directed Context Management

## Knowledge-Based Products

A knowledge-based product is any output whose primary value lies in the information, expertise, or analysis it contains. This can include documents (books, manuals, reports, policies), structured content (training courses, standards, knowledge bases), and digital artefacts such as software, where the embedded rules, logic, and data represent codified knowledge. In all cases, the emphasis is on creating, organising, and delivering knowledge in a usable form.

The lifecycle of such a product (see Appendix) typically begins with **concept** and **feasibility**, where needs are identified and options assessed. It moves through **definition** and **development**, where requirements are set and the product is created, followed by **acceptance** and **release** to confirm and deliver the output. The product then enters **operation and maintenance**, where it is used, monitored, and updated as necessary, before ultimately reaching **retirement**, when it is withdrawn or replaced. This sequence ensures the product remains valuable and relevant throughout its existence.

When aiming to achieve a goal that relates to a knowledge-based product, many approaches are possible. But two broad ones stand out.  

**Project approach** — used when the goal is well understood and can be defined with little uncertainty. Here, acceptable levels of risk to quality, cost, and time allow for a single, goal-directed project.

**Programme approach** — used when the goal contains too much uncertainty for a single tightly-bound project to be viable. The programme comprises successive phases, each with a well-defined purpose that is delivered using the project approach. The purpose is to reduce uncertainty and progressively stabilise towards a well-defined goal. By its nature, a complex goal will usually require this programme approach.
## Project Approach

For a knowledge-based product, a typical project might have the following stages:

- **Initiation** → confirm the product’s purpose, scope, and intended audience; agree acceptance criteria; and identify resources.
    
- **Design & Planning** → define the structure, content outline, and style; create a detailed plan for producing each component of the product.
    
- **Production** → develop the content according to the plan, integrating research, drafting, and iterative review.
    
- **Verification** → check the completed product against acceptance criteria through review, testing, or validation.
    
- **Release & Closure** → finalise, publish or distribute the product, obtain sign-off, and record lessons learned for future work.
    
## Programme Approach

For a knowledge-based product, a typical programme might have the following phases.

- **Concept** → framing the problem, identifying scope, exploring high-level options.
    
- **Feasibility** → evaluating identified options for viability, value, and alignment with objectives; estimating resources, time, and risks; and selecting the preferred approach to take forward.
    
- **Definition** → specifying content requirements, structure, style, and success criteria.
    
- **Development** → creating the material, integrating research, drafting, reviewing.
    
- **Acceptance** → stakeholder review, validation of accuracy, sign-off for publication.
    
- **Operation & Maintenance** → publishing, version control, updates, ongoing relevance checks.
## Contextual Scaffolding

When an AI is part of the team working towards a knowledge-related goal, we need the AI to stay helpful and relevant. To achieve this we must give it the information it needs to do its job in the way we want it done, and that information must evolve alongside the work being done. We use the term contextual scaffolding for this.

Contextual scaffolding defines the scope and substance of what the AI should know at any point in the work. Context is the operational environment in which that scaffolding is applied. In other words, scaffolding determines _what_ information and guidance are relevant, while context determines _how_ that information is held, combined, and used in real time to produce outputs. Together, they ensure the AI is both well-informed and immediately effective.
## Context

An AI’s context is its active workspace, where different layers of information combine to guide its responses. For ChatGPT, these layers include:

- **Project Instructions** — persistent, high-level guidance that defines objectives, constraints, tone, and priorities for the work.
    
- **Canvas** — the shared document workspace holding the current working material for drafting, structuring, and revising.
    
- **Conversation Context** — the running record of the current conversation, enabling continuity between exchanges.
    
- **Referenced Files and External Inputs** — documents or data sources explicitly loaded into the project to provide factual grounding.
    
- **System Layer** — underlying rules and behaviours set by OpenAI and project settings.
    

These layers work together as follows: the System Layer and Project Instructions establish long-term guidance; the Canvas and Conversation Context manage the immediate working state; Referenced Files supply just-in-time knowledge. The AI blends these elements within the limits of its context window, which determines how much information it can use at one time.
## Goal-Directed Context Management

The art of goal-directed context management is to align the evolving context with the structure and purpose of the chosen approach, ensuring the AI always has the right information, at the right level of detail, to contribute effectively to the current phase of work.

## Appendix: Knowledge-Based Product Lifecycle

A knowledge-based product life-cycle typically follows this flow:

1. **Concept** – Identify the need or opportunity and outline broad ideas for the product.
    
2. **Feasibility** – Evaluate options for viability, resource needs, and potential impact; select the best option to pursue.
    
3. **Definition** – Specify detailed requirements, structure, and quality criteria.
    
4. **Development** – Produce the product content or code, integrating research, drafting, and review.
    
5. **Acceptance** – Validate the product against agreed requirements and secure formal sign-off.
    
6. **Release** – Publish, distribute, or implement the product for its intended audience.
    
7. **Operation** – The product is used in practice; monitor for performance and relevance.
    
8. **Maintenance** – Update and refine the product to keep it accurate and effective over time.
    
9. **Retirement** – Withdraw the product when it is obsolete, replacing or archiving it as needed.
