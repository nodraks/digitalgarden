# Goal-Directed Context Management

When aiming to achieve a goal that relates to a knowledge-based product, many approaches are possible. But two broad ones stand out.  

**Project approach** — used when the goal is well understood and can be defined with little uncertainty. Here, acceptable levels of risk to quality, cost, and time allow for a single, goal-directed project.

**Programme approach** — used when the goal contains too much uncertainty for a single tightly-bound project to be viable. The programme comprises successive phases, each with a well-defined purpose, delivered using the project approach. The purpose is to reduce uncertainty and progressively stabilise towards a well-defined goal. By its nature, a complex goal will usually require this programme approach.

## Project Approach

For a knowledge-based product, a typical project might have the following product-focused stages:

- **Initiation** → confirm the product’s purpose, scope, and intended audience; agree acceptance criteria; and identify resources.
    
- **Design & Planning** → define the structure, content outline, and style; create a detailed plan for producing each component of the product.
    
- **Production** → develop the content according to the plan, integrating research, drafting, and iterative review.
    
- **Verification** → check the completed product against acceptance criteria through review, testing, or validation.
    
- **Release & Closure** → finalise, publish or distribute the product, obtain sign-off, and record lessons learned for future work.
    

## Programme Approach

For a knowledge-based product, a typical programme might have the following phases.

- **Concept** → framing the problem, identifying scope, exploring high-level options.
    
- **Feasibility** → evaluating identified options for viability, value, and alignment with objectives; estimating resources, time, and risks; and selecting the preferred approach to take forward.
    
- **Definition** → specifying content requirements, structure, style, and success criteria.
    
- **Development** → creating the material, integrating research, drafting, reviewing.
    
- **Acceptance** → stakeholder review, validation of accuracy, sign-off for publication.
    
- **Operation & Maintenance** → publishing, version control, updates, ongoing relevance checks.

When an AI is part of the team working towards a knowledge-based goal, we need the AI to stay helpful and relevant. To achieve this we must give it the information it needs to do its job in the way we want it done, and that information must evolve alongside the work being done. We use the term contextual scaffolding for this.

## Contextual Scaffolding

Contextual scaffolding is the structured set of information and references that keeps the AI aligned with the work’s objectives and current state. It provides the AI with relevant background, an up-to-date view of progress, and clear direction for the next step. In a project or programme setting, this scaffolding must evolve with each stage so the AI remains accurate, relevant, and grounded.

## Context

An AI’s context is its active workspace, where different layers of information combine to guide its responses. For ChatGPT, these layers include:

- **Project Instructions** — persistent, high-level guidance that defines objectives, constraints, tone, and priorities for the work.
    
- **Canvas** — the shared document workspace holding the current working material for drafting, structuring, and revising.
    
- **Conversation Context** — the running record of the current conversation, enabling continuity between exchanges.
    
- **Referenced Files and External Inputs** — documents or data sources explicitly loaded into the project to provide factual grounding.
    
- **System Layer** — underlying rules and behaviours set by OpenAI and project settings.
    

These layers work together as follows: the System Layer and Project Instructions establish long-term guidance; the Canvas and Conversation Context manage the immediate working state; Referenced Files supply just-in-time knowledge. The AI blends these elements within the limits of its context window, which determines how much information it can use at one time.
