# Exploring a collaboration

---
## Background

AI Acclimatisation Lab run by Anapoly, attended by Giles Freathy.
Discussion Giles Freathy / Alec Fearon about possibilities for collaboration between our two organisations.
Collaboration would be designed to extend the capability of both organisations for the social good. 
Students are among those most at risk from the misuse of AI. 
There is a risk that students might outsource their thinking to AI and lose or not acquire the ability for critical thinking. 
Students need to have an ethos of caring about how the human-AI relationship evolves.
Hence idea of an initiative to create an ethos designed to shape Human-AI interaction in the university setting. 

## Purpose of a collaboration  

To explore how values and ethos can shape human–AI interaction in a university setting.

## Approach  

The main deliverable could be a substantive, long-form essay offering a credible academic contribution to the issues facing higher education. 

We could frame this as a time-bounded programme of work making use of the Anapoly AI Labs. The work would form a live, documented case study in the effective, ethical, and collaborative use of AI tools.

One possibility is to structure the programme in the same way as an MSc.

Indeed, the work could be undertaken by an MSc student, the deliverable being a dissertation. What would be a good research question?

Another possibility is for the work to be undertaken by a collaborating team of MSc students, each focusing on one aspect of the problem. What would be a good suite of research questions?

## Twofold value 

**Academic output** – A credible, well-researched essay proposing a framework of values and ethos for guiding human–AI interaction.

**Applied learning** – A live, documented example of using AI in a real intellectual task, showing good practice in configuration, transparency, and collaboration.
