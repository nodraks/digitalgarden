# ChatGPT-5's context architecture

Imagine ChatGPT-5's context as its **dynamic workspace**, a meticulously organised environment where different layers of information come together to help it understand you and respond appropriately. This isn't just a simple memory; it's a sophisticated setup that ensures the AI always has the right information at its "fingertips" to perform tasks effectively. Within this workspace, several key component parts work in harmony.

**Project Instructions** are like a **mission statement pinned to the wall** for a particular project. They provide high-level, persistent guidance that applies across all your interactions within that project. Their purpose is to act as the AI's **compass**, defining the overarching goals, constraints, desired tone, and priorities, ensuring the AI consistently behaves as the kind of partner you need it to be.

Next, there's the **Canvas**, which you can think of as the **central page on your desk** where you and a colleague might be writing and revising together. This is a document-centred workspace where you and the AI directly collaborate on tasks, such as drafting text or structuring outputs. Its crucial role is to hold the **current working material**, whether it's text, a specific structure, or notes, providing a shared focus for your ongoing interaction.

Then we have the **Conversation Context**, also known as the **Context Window**, which serves as the AI's **short-term working memory**. It's the running record of your current conversation, including the most recent exchanges and any files you might have just mentioned or referenced. Its purpose is to enable the AI to link each new reply to what has just been discussed, much like **remembering the last few turns in a meeting** to keep the conversation coherent and relevant.

**Referenced Files and External Inputs** are like **having a set of reference books open beside you**. These are documents such as PDFs, text files, or web content that you explicitly load into your project. Their role is to provide **factual grounding**, allowing the AI to directly consult and refer to them when formulating its responses, ensuring accuracy and depth.

Finally, the **System Layer** operates mostly behind the scenes, like the **operating rules of a workplace**. These are instructions originating from OpenAI itself, which you don't directly see, and they are combined with your project's specific settings.  The role of the system layer is to set the fundamental safety rules, govern the AI's overall behaviour, and determine which features are available to you.

These different layers are integrated into a cohesive system. When you interact with ChatGPT, the **System Layer** and **Project Instructions** establish the **persistent background**; they provide the long-term guidance that consistently shapes the AI's approach. The **Conversation Context** and the **Canvas** then collectively manage the **current working state**, focusing on the immediate tasks and interactions. Meanwhile, **Referenced Files** are brought in to supply **just-in-time knowledge** whenever it's required.

The AI effectively blends all these elements together to form its response, always operating **within the limits of its context window**. This has a maximum size, governing the amount of information it can "keep in mind" at any given moment.
