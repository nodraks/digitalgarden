### üß± Contextual Scaffolding Framework

If we want AI to stay helpful and relevant, we need to give it the right information, and that information is held in its context. Importantly, that context must evolve alongside and keep pace with the work being carried out. We use contextual scaffolding to achieve this.

Think of contextual scaffolding as a guide rope for the AI. At every stage, it provides the right background, an up-to-date view of progress, and clear direction for the next step. Crucially, it also gives the AI access to the current state of all deliverables, so its input builds on the latest versions rather than repeating or contradicting past work.

To develop a knowledge-based product in collaboration with an AI, we use contextual scaffolding in the form of two complementary models: a **phase model** to structure the overall lifecycle, and a **project model** to guide collaborative work within each phase.

The phase and project models are flexible and should be applied with as light a touch as possible. The AI will assist in mapping out this programme of work ‚Äî a key part of its contextual scaffolding.

#### üîÅ Phase Model (Cradle-to-Grave Structure)
The phase model provides end-to-end structure across the full lifecycle of the product.

1.  **Concept** ‚Äî Explore potential benefits, clarify purpose, and draft a business case.
2.  **Definition** ‚Äî Specify the intended final deliverable in sufficient detail to support structured development.
3.  **Development** ‚Äî Develop and test the final product.
4.  **Acceptance** ‚Äî Validate the deliverable in the hands of its intended users, ensure it meets defined needs, and bring it into use.
5.  **Operation and Maintenance** ‚Äî Use, monitor, and refine the product until it is retired.

Not every phase will require a full project structure, but where structured collaboration is needed, the project model applies.

#### üß± Project Model (Within-Phase Scaffolding)
Within each phase, a project-based approach provides structure for collaborative delivery.

##### 1. **Defined Goal**
The project is established to deliver a clear, knowledge-based product. Typically, this will be the output required from a phase.

##### 2. **Project-Based Structure**
Work within the phase is organised into discrete **stages**, each with defined objectives and outputs.

##### 3. **Stage Gates**
Progression from one stage to the next requires a quality review of outputs. Only satisfactory products allow forward movement.

##### 4. **Product-Focused**
Each stage produces one or more **interim products**. Most are "technical" in nature and build towards the final deliverable; some are to manage progress.

##### 5. **Human-AI Collaboration**
The AI acts as a **collaborator**.
*   The **human is the decision-maker**.
*   The AI adapts to the nature of work at hand.
*   Because contextual scaffolding keeps pace with the progress of work, the AI remains grounded and its responses stay relevant and precise.

##### 6. **Adapted PRINCE2 Principles**
Draws selectively from PRINCE2, including:
*   Product-based planning
*   Management by exception (e.g. gates)
*   Clear roles and responsibilities
*   Embedded quality control

##### 7. **Quality Management**
A simplified quality management process ensures control:
*   Each product has a defined **description** or acceptance criteria
*   Quality is assessed at **stage gates**
*   Feedback loops enable iteration and correction

#### üìÑ Example: Preparing a Competitive Tender
When preparing a competitive tender, the knowledge product is a complete, high-quality bid submission. However, at the outset, the scope, fulfilment strategy, resource requirements, and pricing model will not be clear.

**Phase Model in Action** The work progresses through phases - starting with a concept phase to assess feasibility and value, followed by definition (specifying scope and win themes), development (producing the actual bid), acceptance (review and sign-off), and finally operation and maintenance (post-submission follow-up or revision).

**Project Model in Each Phase** Within each phase, a lightweight project structure is applied to guide collaboration with the AI. For example, in the definition phase, the AI helps analyse requirements, map obligations, and develop outline responses. In the development phase, it helps draft, refine, and format bid content.

**Contextual Scaffolding** At every stage, contextual scaffolding ensures the AI is working with the right background, priorities, and current materials‚Äîso it can focus on what matters most, and contribute in ways that are coherent, precise, and aligned with both the tender requirements and internal strategy.
