# Refined Key Questions for Literature Review

I asked the AI to suggest how the key questions we had identified earlier should now be refined to make them better suited to a literature review. We didn’t want to change their *scope* (see [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Project Instructions for AI & Young People Essay#3. Key Questions\|Project Instructions for AI & Young People Essay#3. Key Questions]]), simply to make them more **operational** for the literature review, so they can act as sorting and tagging criteria rather than just big-picture guiding questions. 

Right now, the key questions are strategic:

> What are the main temptations for young people to outsource their thinking to AI?    
> What dangers arise from these temptations?

For the initiation phase, we can turn these into **research-ready questions** that:

- are **specific enough** to guide what we look for in each source;    
- map naturally onto table columns, tags, and a temptation–danger–mitigation chain; and 
- cover both internal and external sources in the same framework.

The AI offered the following operational rewrite of the questions. They seemed good, so I accepted them pending more detailed consideration. The intention is to use these as the **capture criteria** for each source, so that the literature review will naturally produce well-structured content for the later analysis and synthesis phases of work.

## Key Questions

### 1. Temptations to Outsource Thinking

**Strategic:** What are the main temptations for young people to outsource their thinking to AI?  
**Operational Sub-Questions:**

- What specific _behaviours_ are described as outsourcing thinking?    
- What _motivations_ or needs lead to these behaviours? (e.g., speed, convenience, perceived accuracy, avoiding effort, social/peer influence, anxiety about performance)    
- What _contexts_ are these behaviours most associated with? (e.g., academic writing, decision-making, problem-solving, creative work)    
- Which demographic subgroups are mentioned? (university students, school pupils, early-career professionals)    
- Are there differences in temptation between disciplines or fields of study?

### 2. Dangers Arising from These Temptations

**Strategic:** What dangers arise from these temptations, and how do they manifest differently for university students?  
**Operational Sub-Questions:**

- Which _capabilities_ or _habits_ are at risk? (e.g., critical thinking, independent research, reflective judgement, creativity)    
- How do these dangers manifest in academic or personal development?    
- Are there specific _examples or case studies_ in the source?    
- Are dangers _short-term_ (e.g., reduced learning in a course) or _long-term_ (e.g., dependency, professional unpreparedness)?    
- What _differences_ are observed between younger students and university students?    
- Are dangers framed as _direct consequences_ of AI use or _indirect effects_ via cultural or institutional changes?

### 3. Nature of “Responsible AI Use”

**Strategic:** What constitutes “responsible AI use” in this context?  
**Operational Sub-Questions:**

- How does the source define or describe “responsible” use?    
- What _practices_ or _habits_ are recommended? (e.g., fact-checking, combining AI with human review, limiting use to certain stages of work)    
- Are there any _ethical frameworks_ or _guidelines_ referenced?    
- How does the source suggest users balance AI assistance with independent thinking?

### 4. Mitigation of Dangers Through Responsible AI Use

**Strategic:** Can responsible AI use mitigate these dangers effectively, and if so, how?  
**Operational Sub-Questions:**

- Which specific dangers are addressed by responsible use in the source?    
- What _mechanisms_ or _strategies_ are proposed? (e.g., education, tool design, institutional policy)   
- Is there evidence of effectiveness? (research findings, pilot programmes, anecdotal reports)    
- What are the _limits_ of responsible use — where might dangers persist despite good practice?    
- Does the source propose _systemic changes_ (e.g., curriculum redesign) or focus on _individual responsibility_?
