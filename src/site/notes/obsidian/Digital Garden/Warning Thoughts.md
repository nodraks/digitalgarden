# Warning Thoughts
*from Dennis Silverwood*

--- 
AI has burst upon us ... the answer to all our prayers and problems. Or is it?

Friendship - AI is not your friend. AI has no interest in you, your emotions, your future etc.

AI does not have access to all the information which you have access to. 1. Models have latency in their training using public sphere information.  What you get from AI may be redundant or obsolescent. 2. Models do not have access to reserved or private material and answers may therefore be incomplete.

Bad actors can see what you (either anonymously or personally) are doing.

AI detaches you from reality.

Is may not be telling you the truth. What is truth? Does AI check/ triangulate/ critique itself?

AI is not intelligent. Intelligence is the ability acquire and apply knowledge and skills.
