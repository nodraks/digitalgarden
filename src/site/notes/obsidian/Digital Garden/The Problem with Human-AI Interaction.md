# The Problem with Human-AI Interaction

---

Dennis Silverwood put forward some [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Warning Thoughts\|Warning Thoughts]]. 

To get a better understanding of the nature of the problem, we decided to write an essay about it. This will examine the dangers posed to young people by the temptation to outsource their thinking to AI, and also explore whether responsible use of AI can mitigate these dangers. As well as making us better informed, the essay will serve as a good vehicle for learning about the practicalities of putting AI to purposeful use.

Some background is needed here. If we want AI to stay helpful and relevant, we need to give it the right information, and <a href="https://anapoly.co.uk/labs/context-is-the-new-user-interface/">as explained in this diary post</a> that information is held in its context. Importantly, that context must evolve alongside and keep pace with the work being carried out. So it's important to understand what context is, because that is what controls ChatGPT's behaviour. [[obsidian/Digital Garden/ChatGPT-5 context architecture\|ChatGPT-5 context architecture]] gives a more detailed, non-technical explanation of this, and the [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Contextual Scaffolding Framework\|Contextual Scaffolding Framework]] explains how to structure context during the development of a knowledge-based product. 

Turning back to our proposed essay, the starting point was to enlist help from ChatGPT for this work. First, we worked with the AI to craft a [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Prompt to build contextual scaffolding\|Prompt to build contextual scaffolding]]. Then, as the scaffolding took shape, we were able to craft [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Project Instructions – AI & Young People\|Project Instructions – AI & Young People]] tailored to the specifics of this essay. When writing these, it was important to draw a [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Distinction between Project Instructions and Project Files\|Distinction between Project Instructions and Project Files]] 

With [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Project Instructions – AI & Young People\|Project Instructions – AI & Young People]] now installed, we turned our attention to strengthening the initiation phase. We wanted to set up the literature review for maximum quality and relevance. There was a great deal more to this than I had expected; I had to remind myself how many projects are setup to fail from the outset by not spending enough effort on getting the foundations right. 

First, we [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Refined key questions for literature review\|Refined key questions for literature review]]. This prompted me to consider giving the literature review to a team of, say, five people, dividing up the key questions accordingly.
