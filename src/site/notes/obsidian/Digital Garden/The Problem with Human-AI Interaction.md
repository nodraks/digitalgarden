# The Problem with Human-AI Interaction

---

Dennis Silverwood put forward some [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Warning Thoughts\|Warning Thoughts]]. These begin by asserting that, although widely called artificial intelligence, AI is not in fact intelligent. They end by highlighting the risk that people might outsource their thinking to AI and lose or never acquire the ability for critical thinking. While all age groups are at risk from outsourced thinking, the young are especially so. They already show signs of shorter attention spans, limiting their capacity to follow complex arguments, absorb nuanced information, and sustain reasoning without distraction. If this is compounded by outsourcing their thinking and failing to develop critical thinking skills, they risk losing the judgement and decision-making ability essential to independent agency.

To get a better understanding of the nature of the problem, we propose to write an essay about it. This will examine the dangers posed to young people by the temptation to outsource their thinking to AI, and explore whether responsible use of AI can mitigate these dangers. As well as making us better informed, the essay will serve as a vehicle for learning the practicalities of putting AI to purposeful use.

Some background is needed here. If we want AI to stay helpful and relevant, we need to give it the right information, and <a href="https://anapoly.co.uk/labs/context-is-the-new-user-interface/">as explained in this diary post</a> that information is held in its context. Importantly, that context must evolve alongside and keep pace with the work being carried out. So it's important to understand what context is, because that is what controls ChatGPT's behaviour. [[obsidian/Digital Garden/ChatGPT-5 context architecture\|ChatGPT-5 context architecture]] gives a more detailed, non-technical explanation of this, and the [[obsidian/Digital Garden/Contextual Scaffolding Framework\|Contextual Scaffolding Framework]] explains how to structure context during the development of a knowledge-based product. 

Turning back to our proposed essay, the starting point was to enlist help from ChatGPT for this work. First, we worked with the AI to craft a [[obsidian/Digital Garden/prompt to build contextual scaffolding\|prompt to build contextual scaffolding]]. Then, as the detailed nature and scope of the work became clear and the scaffolding took shape, we were able to focus on crafting [[obsidian/Digital Garden/project Instructions – AI & Young People\|project Instructions – AI & Young People]] tailored to the specifics of this essay. Note that when writing these, it was important to draw a [[obsidian/Digital Garden/distinction between Project Instructions and Project Files\|distinction between Project Instructions and Project Files]] 

With [[obsidian/Digital Garden/project Instructions – AI & Young People\|project Instructions – AI & Young People]] now installed, we turned our attention to [[obsidian/6 - Main Notes/strengthening the initiation phase\|strengthening the initiation phase]].
