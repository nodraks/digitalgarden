# Project Approach Example — Staff Onboarding Procedure

This example illustrates how the project approach can be applied to the creation of a staff onboarding procedure. The goal is clearly defined from the outset, and the work can be planned and executed in a straightforward sequence with minimal uncertainty. The focus is on producing a complete, accurate, and usable document that guides managers and HR in bringing new employees into the organisation efficiently and consistently.

## Initiation

- Confirm the objective: produce a clear, complete, and user-friendly onboarding procedure for new staff.
    
- Define the scope: covers pre-arrival preparation, first-day orientation, initial training, and probation review process.
    
- Identify stakeholders: HR, department managers, IT support, facilities.
    
- Agree acceptance criteria: accuracy, compliance with legal requirements, ease of use.
    

## Design & Planning

- Develop a detailed outline of the procedure, broken into logical stages.
    
- Assign responsibilities for drafting and reviewing each section.
    
- Set milestones and deadlines for completion.
    
- Identify required resources: existing policy documents, HR forms, IT setup checklists.
    

## Production

- Draft each section of the onboarding procedure.
    
- Incorporate input from stakeholders and relevant reference materials.
    
- Ensure tone, style, and formatting are consistent.
    

## Verification

- Circulate the draft for review by HR, managers, and legal/compliance where required.
    
- Test the procedure with a recent new hire or HR representative to ensure clarity and completeness.
    
- Revise based on feedback.
    

## Release & Closure

- Finalise the onboarding procedure and obtain formal approval from HR leadership.
    
- Publish on the company intranet and provide copies to relevant managers.
    
- Record lessons learned for future procedural updates.
