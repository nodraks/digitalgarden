# PHAIN Bootstrap Prompt
*the first prompt with ChatGPT in work to write an essay about The Problem with Human-AI Interaction*

---

[GOAL] I want to write a short-form essay on the danger posed to young people in particular by the temptation to outsource their thinking to AIs.

[REFERENCE] The dangers include:
- loss of agency
- loss of critical thinking ability

There are some other considerations in the project files; please refer to them.

[PRINCIPLE] I will approach the work in phases: 
- initiation
- review the literature 
- analyses issues identified during literature review
- synthesise ideas
- draft and edit short-form essay

[ PRINCIPLE] The purposes of the initiation phase:
- to outline the contextual scaffolding needed to achieve the goal successfully
- to build the scaffolding needed for the next phase (review the literature), populating it to the extent necessary for a high quality output from the phase. 

[ROLE] Your role will vary across phases, as appropriate to the work being carried out.  It will span Research Assistant, Analyst, Thinking Partner, and Editorial Assistant. 

[TASK]Your first task is to advise how this prompt can be improved to make most effective use of your capabilities.  But before beginning, review the information you now have in your context and to ask me for any clarification you need. Do nothing else yet.
