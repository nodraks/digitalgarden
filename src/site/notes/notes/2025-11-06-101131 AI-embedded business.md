# AI-embedded Business
## Introduction

This document explores what it means for a small business to become **AI-embedded**. That is, to treat artificial intelligence not as a bolt-on tool but as a working member of the organisation. We will examine how control, trust, and responsibility operate when AI systems act as collaborators; how they are **embedded** rather than merely **enabled**. From this, we will develop the methods that make such collaboration durable: contextual scaffolding, context engineering, and the disciplined management of knowledge.

This is very much a **working paper**, not a finished document. The intention is to move step by step:

1. to clarify what embedding AI actually involves; then
2. to define the practices that make it reliable and auditable; and finally
3. to model how an AI-embedded organisation creates and delivers value.

## How do we control an AI?

To use an AI effectively, we have to configure it’s behaviour to suit the purpose of our work. We do this by giving it information in the form of instructions, reference material, and prompts . We put this information into the AI’s context to shape how it behaves.

_Contextual control_, the method of controlling the AI by putting information into its context, is similar to the way we control a computer by giving it a program to run. But there is an important difference: a computer is deterministic, it executes the instructions in its program precisely, whereas an AI _interprets_ the information we give it. We should aim, therefore, to give the AI all the information it needs to avoid losing focus. A vague prompt gets a vague answer. A precise prompt with the right background information gets us something much more useful.

There are similarities with the way we manage a human. The human has a store of learned knowledge to call upon, can be given instructions on how to behave during a task, can use reference material, can converse with others, and can co-edit documents with them. Like an AI, the human interprets the information obtained by these means.

The distinction between _instructional control_ and _contextual control_ is important. Traditional computing is about explicit commands; AI control is about _constraint and alignment_ through shared context. “Control” here really means _steering_, not command and control. We must acknowledge that interpretation of its instructions by an AI introduces _uncertainty_ and _risk of misalignment_. Feedback is essential: testing and review provide the same corrective loop that supervision gives human staff.

## How do we embed AI?

For the reasons explained above, when we adopt AI in a business its characteristics make it more like an additional member of staff than a software tool. Rather than integrate it as a sub-system, we embed AI to make it cooperate within the business. This is similar to how we embed new members of staff.

We also adapt the operation of the business to make make best use of the capabilities of our newly-adopted AI members of staff. Embedding, therefore, is a reciprocal process of _mutual adaptation_: the business reshapes itself around AI capabilities, just as AI configurations evolve with the business. Embedding changes _both_ the AI’s behaviour and the human routines around it. An AI-embedded business is one in which this process of adoption and adaptation is taking place.

## Contextual Scaffolding

The AI, like a human member of staff, must be given roles and assigned tasks. It, too, must be given or otherwise obtain detailed knowledge and information about the task in hand.

Unlike a human, however, if all the knowledge and information it needs is not to hand, the AI cannot yet go and fetch it; the human must provide it. The human does does so by putting relevant knowledge and information into the AI's context. This knowledge and information - the artefacts needed by the AI to carry out its role and tasks successfully - are deployed as required into what we might call the AI's contextual scaffolding.

Human members of a business team can have different roles at different times, and the membership of a team often changes over the course of a job to match the need for different expertise and capabilities. The same applies to AI. It is given different roles by reconfiguring its contextual scaffolding to change its behaviour and capabilities as appropriate to the task in hand. _Agents_ (in the form of what OpenAI calls GPTs) can be set up to provide different kinds of specialist knowledge when needed. Different AI's can be engaged to provide entirely different capabilities as required.

Contextual scaffolding is not a one-off configuration; it changes with the nature of the work being carried out. The scaffolding must therefore be managed as part of the business lifecycle, alongside business processes, policies, and staff capabilities. It should be treated as a **designed artefact** rather than an ad-hoc setup. Each AI role or task requires a defined scaffolding package that includes its purpose, authority limits, reference materials, and update schedule. These packages should be version-controlled, reviewed, and documented so that the business knows which configuration produced which outputs.

In an AI-embedded business, contextual scaffolding becomes part of the operational infrastructure. We maintain the scaffolding in this deliberate way to ensure that AI contributions remain aligned with the changing objectives of the business and that changes in data, policy, or method are traceable.

## Persistent and Temporary Scaffolding

In one-off work such as a project or programme, contextual scaffolding is temporary. It is created for a defined goal, adjusted as the work progresses, and retired when the task ends.

In contrast, much of a business operates through repeatable work: service delivery, billing, recruitment, client support, and similar routines. Here the scaffolding must be **persistent** and **standardised**. It defines how the AI stays aligned with recurring processes and decisions over time.

Persistent scaffolding can be organised into reusable **context packages**: structured sets of instructions, references, and data that are loaded or refreshed whenever a task recurs. Each package acts as a standing environment for a role or function, maintained like any other process asset and refined through experience.

The distinction matters because it determines the purpose of scaffolding. In projects, scaffolding manages **change**; in repeatable work, it maintains **stability**. Together they form a complete framework: temporary scaffolding for innovation and persistent scaffolding for routine operation.

## Context Engineering

Context engineering is the systematic preparation and maintenance of the contextual scaffolding that enables AI to behave and perform as a useful member of the business team.

Where _contextual scaffolding_ defines what the AI needs to know to play its part, context engineering defines how that knowledge is built, stored, and refreshed, making it part of the organisation’s operational fabric so that the AI stays aligned as the business and its work evolve.

The discipline gives structure and traceability to AI use. It ensures that the information shaping AI behaviour is versioned, reviewable, and reusable. It also provides a way to scale: once a sound configuration is in place, it can be adapted for other roles or projects without starting again.

In this sense, context engineering is the operational technology of embedding. It keeps human and AI members of staff working within the same framework of values, procedures, and objectives, and it allows that framework to be maintained as both people and AIs change over time.

## How do we engineer context?

### Why context matters

AI systems don’t understand a business simply because they have access to its data. They perform well only when the right information is presented in the right form. Poorly prepared information leads to **context rot**, the gradual loss of relevance and accuracy as the AI’s “understanding” drifts away from current reality. **Context engineering** prevents that drift. It is the discipline of preparing and maintaining the information environment that allows AI to think and act like a well-briefed team member. In practice, it combines knowledge management, process design, and lightweight governance to keep the AI’s world coherent.

### What context is made of

Every task depends on two kinds of context:

- **Persistent context** – the enduring background: our purpose, goals, policies, tone, and standards.
- **Current context** – the immediate task, project, or situation.

Persistent context provides continuity and alignment; current context gives focus and relevance. The art of context engineering lies in balancing the two, keeping the AI grounded in long-term purpose while tuned to the specifics of the moment.

### How context is built and maintained

Context engineering turns business knowledge into structured, reusable form. It draws on several key technical practices that are documented in detail elsewhere.

**Structured formats** use Markdown, JSON, or similar machine-readable layouts to keep information clear and accessible (_see Information Typing and Format Design_).

A **chunking strategy** divides material into small, self-contained units (typically 100–500 tokens) that each express a single idea or process (_see Chunk Design and RAG Optimisation_).

A **knowledge architecture** helps maintain a consistent hierarchy of files and references so that context can scale from overview to detail (_see Knowledge Management for AI-OS_).

**Context packages**, predefined sets of persistent and current information, can be loaded or refreshed for a recurring task (_see Goal-Directed Context Management_).

**Versioning and traceability** keep track of which context packages, prompts, or reference sets produced particular outputs (_see Context Governance and Audit_).

These techniques make context engineering repeatable. They allow us to update one element without corrupting the whole system and to reuse proven configurations across different projects or roles.

### How context is used

In project work, we build **temporary scaffolding**: context that evolves with the job and is retired when it ends.

In repeatable work, we rely on **persistent scaffolding**: stable, reusable context that keeps AI aligned with daily operations.

Together these form a living knowledge system: temporary scaffolding manages **change**, while persistent scaffolding maintains **stability**. Both are maintained through the same context-engineering discipline.

### The business value

When done well, context engineering turns scattered information into an operational asset. It ensures that every AI instance works from the same understanding as its human counterparts, and that this understanding can be checked, updated, and improved. For the business, it means consistency, traceability, and the ability to scale capability without diluting quality. These are the hallmarks of an **AI-embedded organisation**.
